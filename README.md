I am quite familiar with tests but I didn't do much of them. Since most of my classes could not be test by unit tests since they have external dependencies.

This is my first time with elixir so I struggled a bit with the language but in the end it was easier than I thought. If I would have had more time I would have loved to know a bit more a but language standards and how to do properly.
